## 02_CSS-grid

This project contains multiple **CSS Grid layouts**, each designed to showcase different aspects of grid-based design. The goal is to practice grid properties and learn how to build flexible and responsive layouts using CSS Grid.

### grid-1

A simple **3x3 grid** layout demonstrating the fundamental concepts of CSS Grid.

### grid-2

A layout demonstrating how **grid items can span multiple columns and rows**.

### grid-3

This example explores **nesting grids inside grid items** to create more complex layouts.

### grid-7

This **responsive grid-based layout** follows a structured **semantic arrangement**.

- 📱 **On smaller screens:** The **footer moves above the main content**, while `aside` and `nav` are placed below.
- 💻 **For wider screens (`min-width: 760px`)** a **two-column structure** is applied, positioning `aside` and `nav` alongside the `main` content for better usability.

## 04_CSS-flexbox

This project contains multiple **CSS Flexbox layouts**, each designed to showcase different aspects of flexible box-based design. The goal is to practice flex properties and learn how to build adaptable and responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox.

### flex-1

A simple **flex container** demonstrating the fundamental concepts of Flexbox, including `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.

### flex-2

This example demonstrates **flex-wrap** in CSS Flexbox. The `flex-wrap` property allows items to wrap onto multiple lines instead of shrinking to fit within the container.

### flex-3

This example focuses on **flex-basis** and the shorthand `flex` property in CSS Flexbox. This example also highlights the difference between `width` and `flex-basis`

### flex-4-navBar

This example demonstrates how to create a **responsive navigation bar** using CSS Flexbox.

### flex-5-nestedNavBar

This example expands on the previous navigation bar by introducing a **nested flexbox layout** for a social media menu.

- The navigation bar has two `ul` elements: one for main navigation links and one for social media links.
- `display: flex;` is applied to `nav` to create a **flexible navigation structure**.
- The `.social` list is styled as a **flex container**, with each social media item evenly distributed.
- A **grid-based article section** is included, which switches to a stacked layout using JavaScript.
- The layout dynamically changes between **grid and stacked formats** using the `stack` class.

This setup demonstrates **nested flexbox usage** and a **hybrid grid-flexbox approach** for responsive design.

### flex-6

This example demonstrates **flexbox ordering**, which allows elements to be visually rearranged **without changing the HTML structure**. This technique is useful for dynamically **changing layouts without modifying the HTML**.

## 05_CSS-variables

This project demonstrates the use of **CSS variables** to create dynamic, reusable styles across the website. The focus is on leveraging **CSS custom properties** for colors, layouts, and other elements to make the design adaptable and easy to maintain.

### variables-1

This project demonstrates how **CSS variables** can be used to manage layout and color schemes. The goal is to create reusable, maintainable styles that can be easily customized across the site. It showcases how to:

- Define **custom properties** for colors and layout.
- Apply these variables consistently across different elements.
- Use **media queries** to adjust the layout for responsiveness.
